Ok so essentially, just now I got an email saying my LFS was shut down because I reached my storage limit. I checked my au3 and it was like 1.8 GB on its own, which, it shouldn't be like that. It turns out Audacity has a bug where if you save while it's freeing up undo history it just makes the file size massive. I don't know enough about running git commands to manually free up the LFS storage and supposedly the only other option alternative to that is deleting this repo entirely then making a new one. I'm not gonna do that so I don't lose the commit history on here. So instead here's a link to a Google Drive where hopefully you can download the fixed file size of the latest delaceycottage.au3.
