<h1>De Lacey's Cottage</h1>
<h2>By Alexander Ocampo</h2>

*De Lacey's Cottage* is an audio narrative which interprets a scene form Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*. In the scene, the monster had just scared off a beloved group of humans who he's been observing for a while. In his anger, he destroys where they lived, trampling their garden and setting their cottage ablaze, before wandering off into the woods. This piece attempts to explore various means to build suspense, the ways in which timing affects emotional perception, and what place overwhelm has in cultivating an auditory experience.

This project was created for the University of Pittsburgh's Composing Digital Media class of Spring 2022.
